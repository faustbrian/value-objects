 * Global Trade Item Number (GTIN-8) for compact product identification.
 *
 * GTIN-8 is an 8-digit GS1 identifier used for small retail products where space
 * constraints prevent the use of standard GTIN-13 barcodes. Also known as EAN-8,
 * it is primarily used for small items like chewing gum, cosmetics, and other
 * products with limited packaging surface area. The 8 digits include a GS1
 * prefix, item reference, and check digit validated using the Luhn algorithm.
